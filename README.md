# C++ is for everyone: Notes  

**Jan 10th 2024**

## Chapter 1  

### 1.1 What is programming?  

The act of designing and implementing computer programs is called programming.  
  
### 1.2 The anatomy of a computer
  
CPU  
- the heart of the computer  
  
Storage
- Two main types
    - Memory
        - These store data
    - Disks
        - A space where items on a computer can be stored when not in use  
  
I/O  
- Input output which is how you connect keybords headphones and the mouse to the computer  

GCU
- Graphics unit which will allow for the programs to push onto a screen  

### 1.3 Machine code and programming languages  
Computers run on 1s and 0s C++ is a machine langauge that allows humans to communicate with computers in order to simplify the process of a computer over all achiving more effficent forms of working on and with computers.  

### 1.4 Becoming familiar with your programming environment
During this section I practiced using the g++ compiler after creating a "hello world" c++ file (see hello folder) i compiled it and ran it as a program in the terminal (see "hw" in the hello folder)  

### 1.5 Analyzing your first porgram
We took a quick look into the meaning behind most of the lines written in the hw.cpp file (found in the hello folder). A quick and simple dive into understadning why we use #inculde < iostream > or other important parts of simple code.

### 1.6 Errors
Compile time error 
- A violation of the programming language rules that id detected by the compiler.  

Run time error
- An erorr that causes a program ot take an action that the programmer did not intend.  

### 1.7 Problem solving: algorithm design
