# C++ is for everyone: Notes  

**Jan 10th 2024**

## Chapter 1 Introduction 

### 1.1 What is programming?  

The act of designing and implementing computer programs is called programming.  
  
### 1.2 The anatomy of a computer
  
CPU  
- the heart of the computer  
  
Storage
- Two main types
    - Memory
        - These store data
    - Disks
        - A space where items on a computer can be stored when not in use  
  
I/O  
- Input output which is how you connect keybords headphones and the mouse to the computer  

GCU
- Graphics unit which will allow for the programs to push onto a screen  

### 1.3 Machine code and programming languages  
Computers run on 1s and 0s C++ is a machine langauge that allows humans to communicate with computers in order to simplify the process of a computer over all achiving more effficent forms of working on and with computers.  

### 1.4 Becoming familiar with your programming environment
During this section I practiced using the g++ compiler after creating a "hello world" c++ file (see hello folder) i compiled it and ran it as a program in the terminal (see "hw" in the hello folder)  

### 1.5 Analyzing your first porgram
We took a quick look into the meaning behind most of the lines written in the hw.cpp file (found in the hello folder). A quick and simple dive into understadning why we use #inculde < iostream > or other important parts of simple code.

### 1.6 Errors
Compile time error 
- A violation of the programming language rules that id detected by the compiler.  

Run time error
- An erorr that causes a program ot take an action that the programmer did not intend.

### 1.7 Problem solving: algorithm design

A squence of steps that is unambiguous, executable and terminating is called an *algorithm*  
  
## Chapter 2 Fundamental data types
  
### 2.1 Variables
  
A variable is a storage location with a name.
  
#### 2.1.1(2) Variable Definitions and number types
  
int and double 
- int is a whole number a negitive number and zero
    - int cans_per_pack= 6;
- double is decimal or part number as well as intergers and exponential notations
    - double can_volume = 0.355
>review assignments  
  
> better understanding of what is scope

*See progam var in folder var in the github.*

### 2.2 Arithmetic

#### 2.2.1 Arithmetic Operators
- +add 
- -subtract
- *multiply
- /divide

#### 2.2.2 Increment and decrement
<++> adds one to an increment 
<--> subtracts one to an increment

### 2.3 Input and out put

Today i took on a side quest and created a program that uses i/o as well as variables and cin funtions. ( see varibles2.cpp and shopping in the variables file). Over all the program worked very well and was able to funtion as designed allowing me to see that i have a basic understanding of the code in said project.
  
### 2.4 Problem solving 
understanding an issue is made easier by understadning what needs to be done by hand first.. by taking a problem and simplifying it by hand you are able to create the simple algorithm that you will need to create the answer on the computer.  

### 2.5 Strings
a sequence of characters that allow you to work with charcters (see program initials in folder 2_variables )

## Chapter 3 Decisions

### 3.1 The if statement

first explination of *if* will be found in (3_decisions folder file if.cpp) where we right a program that will take you to the right floor in an elevator assuming that one floor (13) is skipped.

### 3.2 Comparing numbers and strings

six types of Relational operators  
    >  
    >=  
    <  
    <=  
    ==  
    !=  
### 3.3 Multiple alternatives

in folder 3 under taxes.cpp you will see the use of multiple alternatives.  

today in chapter 3 so far we have used the variables that we learned in chapter 2 as well as the cin >> funciton to create a workable program where we can plug in info and base on said info the program can choose what has to happen next basied on true false statements and the natural flow charts.
